# passwordgenerator

## Description 

I have completed the code for the password generator, a few weeks ago I remember we were taught about modals, it's great to bring a small peice of that knowledge and put this into practice. For this module challenge I made a random password generator for a user by firstly asking them how long they eant their password to be and what they want inside that password.

I am learning so much in this course and so excited to see it all coming together.
